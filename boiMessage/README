README

Please excuse the shaky code, as this is my first app

Feel free to use / discard the icon, I made it for personal use.

You may want to host a JSON array of strings on a remote location so that the program will provide random, updatable strings

You can find this URL to change in ContentView.webJSONTry()

You can also modify the msgs.json resource in Bundle.main to change the default strings for offline / first time / fail-safe use.
